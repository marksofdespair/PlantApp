this is where I'll be writing notes for the code because I'm forgetful and easily lose track of larger goals.

PLANT MODULE
-class
-should retain scientific name
-should retain common name
-should retain custom name
-should retain light requirement
-should retain updateable waterstat
-should retain pot description
!jk this got scrapped real fast as a module :')

WATER VALUE
-Updates Waterstat by +1 points every day.

ADD
-Feedback for when a plant is added succesfully. Oh no. Does that require I write a throw/catch? Well shit.
